### Hi there 👋
I'm Supravat Paul, a Computer Science student with a strong curiosity for how technology can solve real-world problems. My academic interests mostly revolve around cybersecurity, technical innovations, and web development — areas where I enjoy blending logic with creativity.

Beyond academics, I have a passion for photography, cycling, and exploring spiritualism and ancient wisdom. I believe in maintaining a balance between technical growth and personal development, and I'm always eager to learn, build, and contribute to meaningful projects.

Let’s connect and create something impactful together!
